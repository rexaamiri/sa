00:00:00 In this section, the speaker, Justin Zeltzer from ZStatistics.com, discusses survival analysis and its applications across various fields. The topic centers around measuring survival time, AKA time to event analysis, which is concerned with the time that an event takes to occur after an exposure, such as a diagnosis. Survival analysis can be used to assess the progression of a disease like cancer, the survival of a company after a stock market shock or even survival rates of social institutions like marriage. The speaker emphasizes that survival analysis is essential in assessing survival time and its applications are diverse.
00:05:00 for further discussion, we need to collect data on the survival rates of people diagnosed with lung cancer and analyze this data to study survival rates and the time since diagnosis. To analyze the data, we reset the survival times, so that they start at the same point, in order to calculate and plot survival rates on a Kaplan-Meier curve, which represents the non-parametric curve of survival rates over time, based on the data. We can visualize the survival rates of patients using this curve, which helps to understand the proportion of patients surviving over a certain timeframe. The applications of survival analysis are vast, and it can be applied in various fields, including health, engineering, and finance.
00:10:00 In this section, the speaker introduces survival analysis as a statistical method used to assess the time it takes for an event to occur. Survival analysis can be applied in various fields, including healthcare, manufacturing, finance, and social contexts. It is not limited to assessing negative events like death but can also be used to measure positive events like divorce or the time it takes for a couple to have their second child after the first. In sports, survival analysis can be used to determine the optimum time for a substitution in soccer. The video series will continue with a discussion on censoring, a crucial concept for survival analysis.

00:00:00 In this section, the concept of censoring and truncation in survival analysis is discussed. Censoring occurs when the exact time to an event is unknown for an included observation. There are three types of censoring: left censoring, interval censoring, and right censoring. Left censoring refers to knowing that the time to event is less than a specific value, interval censoring refers to knowing the time to event falls between two values, and right censoring refers to knowing that the time to event is greater than a specific value. An example of right censoring is given in a study on estimating survival time after a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, where individuals who did not die by the end of the study period were censored and their time to event is uncertain.
00:05:00 In this section, the video explains different types of censoring and truncation in survival analysis. Censoring occurs when there is incomplete information about the exact time of an event, such as death. Left censoring happens when individuals have already experienced the event before entering the study, while right censoring occurs when there is no information about the event beyond a certain point. Truncation, on the other hand, refers to observations being excluded from the data set based on their time to event. Left truncation occurs when observations with short times to event are excluded, while right truncation excludes observations with long times to event. The video clarifies that the term "truncation" is often used to describe the exclusion of observations in the data set as a whole rather than referring to individual observations.
00:10:00 In this section, the video discusses two types of truncation in survival analysis: left truncation and right truncation. Left truncation occurs when the shortest survival times are missing from the data set, which can introduce bias. An example of left truncation is the study on animal neonates, where neonates with very short survival times might not have been available for sampling. On the other hand, right truncation occurs when the data set is biased towards individuals who experience an event quickly. An example of right truncation is the study on the time to development of AIDS, where individuals with long times to event were not included in the study since they had not yet developed AIDS by the time it finished. Accounting for truncation is important in survival analysis to ensure accurate estimation of survival times.
